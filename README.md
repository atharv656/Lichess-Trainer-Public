# Chess-Trainer

Bot to assist with chess progress. In an attempt to "seriously" start learning openings, this bot evaluates the previous games played, 
ranks openings by how well I play them and tells me which opening is my worst (the opening with that I most consistently score pporly with).

Gonna play with more features/refinement as wellâ€”perhaps spitting out the pgn of the opening up to depth 10 or something to input to a chess tempo study.
