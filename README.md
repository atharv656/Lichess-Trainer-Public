# Chess Trainer

Bot to assist with chess progress. In an attempt to "seriously" start learning openings, this bot evaluates the previous games played, 
ranks openings by how well I play them and tells me which opening is my worst (the opening with that I most consistently score pporly with).

Gonna play with more features/refinement as wellâ€”perhaps spitting out the pgn of the opening up to depth 10 or something to input to a chess tempo study.


## Todo:
* Opening training
  * Add api to find pgn of top lines in opening at some depth (10)
  * Add bottom opening pgns to text files or smthg
  * Add those openings to Chess tempo, spend 10 minutes daily on opening training?
* Analyze Results
  * Add workflow to log number of rapid games played + rapid rating daily
  * Add graph of data points or smthg
